# combrise-between-all-unsupervised-machine-learning-algorithms-for-model-classification.
# In this project we will combrise between all unsupervised machine learning algorithms for model classification. We will go through 6 tasks to implement our project:  Task 1: Import the important library and exploring the dataset.  Task 2: Identifying Missing Data and dealing with them.  Task 3: Creating visual methods to analyze the data.  Task 4: Kmeans cluster model.  Task 5: hierarichal cluster model.  Task 6: DB scan cluster model
